# Feature Planning Workflow

## Overview
This guide explains how to break down user requirements into actionable tasks and maintain organized development.

## Required Files Structure

### 1. FEATURELIST.md - Source of Truth (UPDATE TRIGGERS)

**When to Update FEATURELIST.md:**
- ‚úÖ **Task completion**: When all TASKS.md items for a feature are complete
- ‚úÖ **Scope changes**: When user adds/removes/modifies features  
- ‚úÖ **Feature discovery**: When implementation reveals new requirements
- ‚úÖ **Version planning**: When preparing next sprint/release

```markdown
# Feature List for [App Name]

## Version 1.0 (Current Sprint)
- [x] User authentication ‚Üê Mark [x] when ALL auth tasks complete in TASKS.md
- [x] Basic CRUD for [entity] ‚Üê Mark [x] when ALL CRUD tasks complete
- [üîÑ] Search and filtering ‚Üê Mark [üîÑ] when any related task starts
- [ ] Export functionality

## Version 1.1 (Next Sprint)  
- [ ] Advanced permissions
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Email notifications

## Recently Added (During Development)
- [ ] User profile management ‚Üê Add here if discovered during implementation
- [ ] Data validation improvements

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Optimize GraphQL queries
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling  
- [ ] Improve loading states

## Status Legend
- [ ] Not started
- [üîÑ] In progress (at least one related task active in TASKS.md)
- [x] Complete (all related tasks complete in TASKS.md)
```

### 2. TASKS.md - Implementation Tracking (EXECUTION DOCUMENT)
```markdown
# Development Tasks

## Setup & Configuration
- [ ] Initialize project structure
- [ ] Configure GraphQL client  
- [ ] Setup routing
- [ ] Remove default sidebar (check if navigation needed)

## Feature: [Feature Name from FEATURELIST.md]

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Check CLOUD.md for schema documentation
- [ ] Call get_schema_details("SchemaName") to verify field types
- [ ] Create GraphQL queries matching exact schema types
- [ ] Create GraphQL mutations with correct input types
- [ ] Setup React Query hooks

### UI Components  
- [ ] Create list view with AdvanceDataTable
- [ ] Create add/edit forms with React Hook Form
- [ ] Add ConfirmationModal for delete operations
- [ ] Hide sidebar unless TASKS require navigation
- [ ] Remove "design only" labels if present

### Data Operations
- [ ] Test Create operation - verify types match
- [ ] Test Read/List operation - check pagination
- [ ] Test Update operation - verify _id filtering
- [ ] Test Delete operation - soft delete by default

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Run linting (npm run lint)
- [ ] Run type checking  
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify NoSQL patterns (no JOINs, use references)
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Tasks should be **granular and executable** (complete in 15-30 min)
- Update status immediately: `[ ]` ‚Üí `[üîÑ]` ‚Üí `[x]`
- If a task reveals more work, add sub-tasks below it
- **This is your execution guide** - work through it linearly

### 3. SCRATCHPAD.md - Append-Only Notes (TOP)
```markdown
# Development Notes (Newest First)

---
[2024-01-20 10:30] Completed user authentication
- Used BasePasswordForm for consistency
- Added remember me checkbox
- Need to implement password reset next

---
[2024-01-20 09:15] GraphQL field name issue
- ERROR: Field 'getUsers' not found
- FIXED: Changed to 'users' (Selise convention)
- Remember: queries use plural, mutations use singular

---
[2024-01-20 08:00] Starting authentication feature
- Creating new branch: feature/user-auth
- Will use React Hook Form + Zod
- Need to check existing auth patterns in codebase
```

### 4. CLOUD.md - Selise Cloud Configuration
```markdown
# Selise Cloud Configuration

## Entities Created

### User Entity
- Created: 2024-01-20
- Fields:
  - email (String, required, unique)
  - password (String, required)
  - role (String, enum: admin|user)
  - createdAt (DateTime)
- Screenshot: ![User Entity](./screenshots/user-entity.png)

### Task Entity
- Created: 2024-01-20
- Fields:
  - title (String, required)
  - description (Text)
  - status (String, enum: pending|completed)
  - userId (Reference to User)
- Screenshot: ![Task Entity](./screenshots/task-entity.png)

## Permissions Configured
- Admin: Full access to all entities
- User: CRUD own tasks only
- Screenshot: ![Permissions](./screenshots/permissions.png)

## API Keys
- GraphQL Endpoint: https://api.selise.cloud/graphql
- API Key: Stored in .env as REACT_APP_API_KEY
```

## Feature Breakdown Process

### Step 0: Schema Analysis & CLOUD.md Setup (FIRST)

After user confirmation, analyze ALL features to determine backend requirements:

```markdown
# Schema Requirements Analysis
Based on confirmed features:
- User Authentication ‚Üí User entity (email, role, password)
- Task Management ‚Üí Tasks entity (title, description, status, userId) 
- File Attachments ‚Üí Files entity (filename, url, taskId)
- Categories ‚Üí Categories entity (name, color)
- Team Management ‚Üí Teams entity (name, memberIds)

# Required Relationships
- Task belongs to User (userId reference)
- Task can have multiple Files (taskId reference)
- Task belongs to Category (categoryId reference)
- User can belong to Team (teamId reference)

# Permission Requirements
- Admin: Full CRUD on all entities
- Manager: CRUD own team's data
- User: CRUD own data only
```

#### CLOUD.md Population Process
1. **Document schema plan** before any MCP operations
2. **Execute MCP operations** for schema creation
3. **Log all operations** with timestamps and results
4. **Document manual fallbacks** if MCP fails
5. **Validate completion** before proceeding to implementation

See: `docs/llm-docs/cloud-setup.md` for complete CLOUD.md workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Feature Requirements
```typescript
// From FEATURELIST.md entry:
"User Management System"

// Break down into:
1. User list view
2. User creation form
3. User edit form
4. User deletion
5. Role assignment
6. Permissions
```

### Step 2: Create Technical Tasks
```markdown
## User Management System

### Feature Structure (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Create feature folder following src/features/inventory/ pattern exactly
- [ ] Setup folder structure: components/, hooks/, services/, types/, index.ts
- [ ] Study inventory feature implementation before starting

### Data Layer
- [ ] Create GraphQL queries for users
- [ ] Create GraphQL mutations (create, update, delete)
- [ ] Setup React Query hooks
- [ ] Add error handling

### UI Components
- [ ] User list with AdvanceDataTable
- [ ] User form with validation
- [ ] Role selector component
- [ ] Delete confirmation modal

### Navigation
- [ ] Remove/hide irrelevant sidebar items
- [ ] Add only app-specific navigation items
- [ ] Configure AppSidebar for this app's needs

### Business Logic
- [ ] Permission checking
- [ ] Email validation
- [ ] Password requirements
- [ ] Audit logging
```

### Step 3: Prioritize and Sequence
```markdown
## Implementation Order

1. **Foundation** (Do First)
   - GraphQL setup
   - Basic list view
   - Route configuration

2. **Core Features** (Do Second)
   - Create functionality
   - Edit functionality
   - Delete functionality

3. **Enhancements** (Do Last)
   - Advanced filtering
   - Bulk operations
   - Export features
```

## Task Status Management

### Status Indicators
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[üîÑ]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[‚ö†Ô∏è]` - Blocked
- `[üîç]` - In review

### Progress Tracking Example
```markdown
### Current Task: User List View [üîÑ]
- [x] Create component structure
- [x] Setup AdvanceDataTable
- [üîÑ] Connect GraphQL query
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error handling

**Blockers**: Waiting for API endpoint from backend
**Notes**: Using inventory feature as reference
```

## Git Workflow Integration

### Branch per Feature
```bash
# For each major feature
git checkout -b feature/user-management

# For sub-tasks if needed
git checkout -b feature/user-management-list-view
```

### Commit Messages Tied to Tasks
```bash
# Reference task in commit
git commit -m "feat: implement user list view with AdvanceDataTable

- Added GraphQL query for users
- Setup AdvanceDataTable with sorting
- Added loading and error states

Task: User Management System - List View"
```

## Common Task Patterns

- [ ] Add Zod validation
- [ ] Connect mutations
- [ ] Handle success/error

### Delete
- [ ] Add delete button
- [ ] Setup ConfirmationModal
- [ ] Connect delete mutation
- [ ] Refresh list after delete
```

### Authentication Tasks
```markdown
## Authentication System

### Login
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Setup auth context
- [ ] Token management
- [ ] Redirect logic

### Registration
- [ ] Registration form
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Password requirements
- [ ] Terms acceptance

### Security
- [ ] Protected routes
- [ ] Token refresh

- [ ] Session management
```

## Decision Documentation

Always document key decisions in SCRATCHPAD.md:

```markdown
---
[Date Time] Architecture Decision: State Management
- Considered: Redux, Zustand, Context
- Chose: Zustand
- Reason: Simpler than Redux, better than Context for complex state
- Reference: Used in inventory feature
```

## Review Checklist

Before marking a task complete:

```markdown
## Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] Feature works as specified
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Responsive design verified
- [ ] Code follows patterns from existing features
- [ ] GraphQL queries optimized
- [ ] Permissions checked (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests written (if applicable)
```

## MANDATORY: Inventory Pattern Following

### Before Creating Any Feature
```bash
# ALWAYS study inventory structure first
ls -la src/features/inventory/

# Required folder structure to replicate:
src/features/[your-feature]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/           # Feature-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/               # Feature-specific hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # API calls and business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/               # TypeScript interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts            # Clean exports
```

### Pattern Analysis Checklist
- [ ] **Component organization** - How are components grouped?
- [ ] **Service layer structure** - How are API calls organized?
- [ ] **Type definitions** - What naming conventions are used?
- [ ] **Hook patterns** - How are React Query hooks structured?
- [ ] **Export strategy** - What gets exported in index.ts?

### Implementation Rules
1. **Never deviate** from inventory folder structure
2. **Mirror naming conventions** exactly
3. **Follow service patterns** for consistency
4. **Use same export approach** in index.ts

## CRITICAL: After Tasks.md Creation

### Continue to Implementation (CLAUDE.md Step 5)
Once TASKS.md is populated with technical tasks:
1. **STOP** - Do not start implementing yet
2. **Return to CLAUDE.md step 5**: "Implementation Process"  
3. **Work through TASKS.md line by line**:
   - Pick first `[ ]` task
   - Change to `[üîÑ]` when starting
   - Implement following recipes
   - Mark `[x]` when complete
   - Update SCRATCHPAD.md with notes
4. **NEVER** skip ahead in TASKS.md
5. **ALWAYS** complete current task before moving to next
6. **If blocked**: Document in SCRATCHPAD.md and move to next task

### Implementation Flow with Tracking Updates
```
TASKS.md ‚Üí Pick Task ‚Üí Update [üîÑ] ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Update [x] ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Next
     ‚Üë         ‚Üì                         ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì           ‚Üì        ‚Üì
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SCRATCHPAD.md ‚Üê Log decisions ‚Üê Log errors ‚Üê Log fixes ‚Üê Update notes ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚Üì
         FEATURELIST.md ‚Üê Update when feature complete
              ‚Üì
         CLOUD.md ‚Üê Update if schemas/config changed
```

### Commit & Update Rhythm
```bash
# EVERY TASK COMPLETION:
1. Update TASKS.md: [üîÑ] ‚Üí [x]
2. Add to SCRATCHPAD.md: Implementation notes
3. Git add all changes (code + tracking files)
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Move to next task

# EVERY FEATURE COMPLETION:
1. Update FEATURELIST.md: Mark feature complete
2. Review all related TASKS.md items are [x]
3. Major commit with feature summary
4. Consider merging to main
```

## Best Practices

1. **Study inventory first** - MANDATORY before any feature work
2. **One task at a time** - Focus prevents context switching
3. **Document blockers** immediately in SCRATCHPAD.md with `[‚ö†Ô∏è]`
4. **Update status IN REAL-TIME** - Not after, but AS you work
5. **Reference existing code** - Check src/features/ for patterns
6. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until end
7. **Commit frequently** - After EVERY task completion (not just features)
8. **Screenshot Selise Cloud** configs for CLOUD.md
9. **Keep tracking files current** - They're your source of truth
